Electricity Price Prediction with Machine Learning
DateTime: Date and time of the record
Holiday: contains the name of the holiday if the day is a national holiday
HolidayFlag: contains 1 if itâ€™s a bank holiday otherwise 0
DayOfWeek: contains values between 0-6 where 0 is Monday
WeekOfYear: week of the year
Day: Day of the date
Month: Month of the date
Year: Year of the date
PeriodOfDay: half-hour period of the day
ForcastWindProduction: forecasted wind production
SystemLoadEA forecasted national load
SMPEA: forecasted price
ORKTemperature: actual temperature measured
ORKWindspeed: actual windspeed measured
CO2Intensity: actual C02 intensity for the electricity produced
ActualWindProduction: actual wind energy production
SystemLoadEP2: actual national system load
SMPEP2: the actual price of the electricity consumed (labels or values to be predicted)
The task here is to use this data to train a machine learning model to predict the price of electricity consumed by the machines.
